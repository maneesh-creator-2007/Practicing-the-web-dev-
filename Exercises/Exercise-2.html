        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We are mostly surrrounded by solids and we use them more often than liquids and gases.For different properties depend upon the nature of constituent particles and the binding forces operating between them. Therefore,study of the structure of solids is important. The correlation between structure and properties helps in discovering new solid materials with desired properties like high temprature superconductors, magetic materials, biodegradable polymers for package, biocompatable solids for surgical implants, etc.</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp From our earlier studies,we know that liquids and gases are called fluids because of their ability to flow. The fluidity in both of these states is due to the fact that the molecules are free to move about. On the contrary. The condtituet particles in solids have fixed positions and can only oscillate about their mean positions. This explains the rigidity in solids. In crystallie solids,the constituent particles are arranged in regular patterns.

        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this chapter, we shall discuss different possible arrangement of particles resulting iin several types of strructures. The correlation between the nature of interaction within te constituent particles and several properties of solids will also be explored. How these  properties get modified due to the structural imperfections or by the presence of impurities in minute amounts would also be discussed.
